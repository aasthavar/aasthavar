## 💼 Work

**Amazon Web Services (2021–now)** – ML Prototyping Engineer

* Built **12+ GenAI/ML prototypes**, 2 scaled into **\$10M+ enterprise deals**
* Designed **distributed training/inference pipelines** (DeepSpeed, FSDP, SMP, SageMaker MP) → AWS case studies
* Benchmarked **inference stacks** (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, sglang) → 70% latency reduction, 80+ QPS
* Demos at **AWS re\:Invent, Summits, ICML 2025 (demo track)**
* **Awards**: AWS All-Star 2025, mentor/judge at **She Builds** & **Technovation Girls**
