# 👋 Hi, I’m Aastha

I work at the intersection of **machine learning and applied research**, with projects spanning **LLMs, agents, robotics, and interpretability**. Over the years I’ve explored problems from **face anti-spoofing** to **embodied intelligence** and **NP-hard optimization with Lego blocks** — always chasing the question: *how can AI solve real-world problems at scale?*

## 💼 Professional Journey

### Amazon Web Services (Aug 2021 – Present)

**ML Prototyping Engineer**
* Led **12+ prototypes** across generative AI and ML research → 2 scaled into **\$10M+ enterprise deals**.
* Designed **distributed fine-tuning and inference pipelines** (DeepSpeed, FSDP, SageMaker MP) → featured as AWS case studies.
* Delivered demos at **AWS re\:Invent**, **Summits**, **OSI 2023**, and **ICML 2025 (demo track)**.
* Recognition: **AWS All-Star Award 2025**, mentor/judge for **She Builds** and **Technovation Girls**.

**Solution Architect Intern** (2021)
* Built an AI-driven NPS feedback platform and scalable NLP pipelines (NER, PDF parsing).
